# Data Science & Analytics

## Data Science

What is data science?

Data science can mean any and all of several areas involving data:

* Preparation
* Modeling
* Analysis
* AI & Machine Learning

 Where do you see data science involved in your own lives? Do you need to use it?

## Tradeoffs

Do you like to compare your options and weight the benefits and drawbacks of your choices? How did you decide what you would eat for dinner yesterday?

### Causation vs Correlation

Your job will require you to breakdown information and options for business leaders. A major part of that involves distilling truth from fiction.

### AI & Machine Learning

Make a computer work and behave like a human does. What makes people different from programs and computers?

**Finite potential.**

A machine is limited by the functions programmed into it, restricting choice and flexibility.

### Us vs Computers

People worry that robots will take over jobs in the future, but the world will always need people and their **ideas**.

## Real World Expectations vs Reality

Data in the real world is messy and the default is not clean.

We want data to be understandable and digestable. Something more like:

Or neatly arranged and understandable:

## Time

Your greatest and most limited resource in life is time. You will need to learn how to prioritize, make hard choices, and say no many times in your career and life.

## Advice

Master the ability to organize and simplify. These two transferable skills that will help you in every career and aspect of life.

A couple of other suggestions:

* Write your ideas
* Become an expert at thinking and learning

### Organize

Stay organized and make it easy for you to find things.

### Simplify

Keep it simple. The problem, the solution, and the discussion 

## Example Project

Get and idea of what data preparation and visualization can look like in a Tableau Dashboard ([US Agriculture data](https://github.com/mklim26/us-agriculture)).

## Getting Started

There is rarely one right answer. Everyday we can continually iterate and improve to work towards something better than what exists today.

General guide:

1. Topic to Explore
1. Data Sources
1. Exploratory Analysis
1. Develop a Solution

### Topic to Explore

Find a topic or problem that interests you. It can be a complex question like improving [Netflix's recommendation engine](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-netflix-prize-how-even-ai-leaders-can-trip-up-5c1f38e95c9f) or something closer to home like predicting who will win the next Patriot's game.

*Note:* Netflix did not use the winning algorithm stating that the incremental improvements did not outweigh the engineering cost as well in addition to Netflix's own changing business model

### Data Sources

Many sites like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data) provide free datasets that you can download and use (including the dataset used in the Netflix challenge).

## Exploratory Analysis

Learn about the data and the current state of the world. It helps me to brainstorm ideas first and start fresh before seeing what exists and what others have tried. Research existing literature to get ideas and save yourself from reinventing the wheel.

## Develop a Solution

Dream **big**. What would your ideal answer look like? Consider what is realistic and achievable. These thoughts can help you develop a plan and focus on how you can execute on your idea. Start small and build a strong understanding. There will always be more to learn.
